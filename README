A basic timer application that allowes users to create various types of timers to track daily events.
Each timer will have a mood which will play music matching tha mood.
Users will be able to open their timers from anywhere on the internet.

We plan to use node.js, express, socket.io, mongodb, jquery, and many other sweet technologies.

To run this application you need MongoDB, Mongoose, and a package called "zombie." To install
"zombie" you can run "npm install zombie".
