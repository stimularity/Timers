A basic timer application that allows users to create timers to track daily events.
The applicaton has the option to enter a mood. A playlist is automatically generated
based on the user's mood. Timers are saved to a database so users will be able to access
their timers from anywhere on the internet. Timers can be deleted and restarted. 

We plan to use node.js, express, socket.io, mongodb, jquery, and many other sweet technologies.

To run this application you need MongoDB, Mongoose, and a package called "zombie." To install
"zombie" you can run "npm install zombie".
